# Houston, the Meteor Blogging Platform

## Running

For now, we need the auth branch. You have two options

1. Use git to download the auth branch and run from that meteor:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meteor/meteor.git
cd meteor
git checkout auth
cd path/to/houston
path/to/checkedoutmeteor/meteor
```

2. Use meteorite to do the above steps for you.

## Customization

More to come.

## Deployment
